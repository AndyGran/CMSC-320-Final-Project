Title for Project: Why The Chiefs Will Be The First Team to 3-Peat in NFL History

In the 2023-2024 National Football League (NFL) Season, the whole world witnessed the Kansas City Chiefs of the NFL secure yet another Superbowl Championship. It was their third in the past five years, and it made them the first team to win back-to-back championships in over two decades! The Chiefs are now favorites for winning this season’s Lombardi Trophy which would make them the first team to ever win three consecutive championships. To put this theory to test, it requires the usage of multiple datasets that span many years and incorporate data such as regular season record, points scored per game, turnouts per game, offensive and defense ratings, strength of schedule, and more. The datasets we plan to use, which may change and expand over time, are as follows:

* Pro Football Reference
This is an umbrella database that consists of numerous detailed data sets (win percentage, season when a team won the championship, total number of touchdowns or interceptions by team) relevant to the task and the aforementioned attributes. We want to first look at the history of the Kansas City Chiefs over a wide enough range of seasons: this website provides that information. For every season since 2004, we can get a breakdown of how the team performed in every aspect on the field. This is important when attempting to determine if they’re destined to three peat. Moreover, we can view the same data for the remaining thirty-one teams in the NFL allowing us to paint the picture of team performance in twenty seasons.

* Nfelo (Strength of Schedule from 2004-2024)
This dataset is imperative for understanding the relative difficulty of each NFL team’s schedule. It’ll be used in conjunction with additional statistics to observe how each team performs against weak or strong opponents. If it appears that the Chiefs perform well against tough competition, this indicates the resilience and strength they have. To predict the results of the 2025 Super Bowl, this dataset is necessary.

* FiveThirtyEight ELO Ratings (What is Elo?)
We’ll be observing the Elo, a metric that essentially defines a team based on head-to-head matchups. This is useful when attempting to identify a pattern with the change in a team’s Elo over a period of time. An increasing trend for one team in comparison to another’s decreasing trend indicates better performance in the former.
